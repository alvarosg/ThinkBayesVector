# ThinkBayesVector
Vector implementations of the exercises on Bayesian statistics from the ThinkBayes book by Allen B. Downey

The [ThinkBayes book](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/), by Allen B.Downey, is a great book to learn Bayesian statistics, providing API and example code to solve the problems in the book. This API is very well structured, howevere, it makes very exhaustive use of loops, without performing vectorized calculations. As a personal challenge, I follows the books, implementing all the exercisies completely from scratch in a much more vectorized way, without using the provided API.
I did this mostly for myself as I was learning a bit more statistics, so it is not strongly structured or commented.
